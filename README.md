# Impact of RNASeq read depth and read length on alternative splicing analysis
****
This Github repository provides the code the for the publication Ladwig et al. 2023.

## 1 Preprocessing and alternative splicing analysis with MAJIQ
****
The Rmarkdown contains the code for the preprocessing of the raw reads and for the subsequent alternative splice analysis with MAJIQ.

The rendered HTML file is available at https://annikala.github.io/. 

## 2 Impact of library characteristics on alternative splice analysis
****
The R scripts contain the code used to investigate the influence of read depth, read length and sample size on: 
- read alignment
- LSV detection
- LSV quantification
- alternative splicing event types distribution
